# Smart Bookmarks

An easy way to find relevant bookmarks on search engines.

## Idea

I saved many bookmarks and reading lists before when I found them and felt it very cool. But, after a long time, they are too much and I can't control it.
So, I thought about that pretty much and finally, I have an idea to build this extension.

### How it works

When we search for a keyword on Google, we will try to look for some cool articles and blogs that match this keyword. Sometimes, it seems to exist on our bookmarks.
So I want to bring all of the relevant links to the keyword on the bookmarks on Google search results and put it to the top of results to use easy to access.

Currently, for the first version I want to make it simple, so I only find the links by title. Soon, I will integrate AI tools like (ChatGPT, Poe, ...) to extract and get the most match links.
